"""``a2ui-component-design`` skill: Claude Code and Codex copies must never drift.

Issue #1533 asks for the same skill under both agent surfaces — ``.claude/skills``
(Claude Code) and ``.agents/skills`` (Codex) — with a test that fails the moment one
copy is edited without the other. clio-schemas is the canonical source (the design
guidance in this file is authored here, once); clio-agent and gact-tui vendor their
own copies and are expected to run the equivalent byte-identity check against
whichever copy they treat as canonical.
